# Credit Risk.Machine learning application.



Abstract 

This is my case studies for my thesis in Banking and Finance about credit scoring.

This work aim to, on one side, the backend code develop on Python Notebook (code_credit_scoring_np.ipynb), for reason of readability, to find the best Hyperparameter in order to achieve the best forecast for the credit scoring with algorithm we analize during the thesis, in particular:

-Logistic regression and Penalized logistic regression (ridge and lasso)
-Lda
-Random Forest

on the other side the code for the web application Streamlit, that is deployed on internet with Heroku

web link: https://creditscoring-ml-thesis.herokuapp.com/

the file:
-Procfile 
-Requirements

are required for allow heroku to deploy from GitHub

How to use the web app:
